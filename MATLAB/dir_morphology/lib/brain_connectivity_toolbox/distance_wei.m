function D=distance_wei(G)
%D=distance_wei(G); distance matrix for weighted directed graph -
%the mean distance is the characteristic path length.
%
%The input matrix must be a mapping from weight to distance (eg. higher
%correlations may be interpreted as short distances - hence an inverse
%mapping is appropriate in that case).

%Dijkstra's Algorithm.
